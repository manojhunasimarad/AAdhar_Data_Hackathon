## **1. Problem Statement & Approach (1 page)**

### ✍️ Draft Text

> Aadhaar enrolment and update activities reflect not only identity management operations but also broader administrative, social, and policy dynamics. Sudden surges, drops, or persistent imbalances in Aadhaar activity may indicate operational backlogs, administrative freezes, policy rollouts, or election-related disruptions.
>
> The objective of this study is to identify **meaningful patterns, trends, and anomalies** in Aadhaar biometric, enrolment, and demographic update data, and translate them into **actionable insights** that can support informed decision-making and system improvements.
>
> Our approach emphasizes:
>
> * Explainable statistical methods over black-box models
> * Persistence-based analysis instead of one-day noise
> * District-level granularity suitable for administrative action
> * Governance-safe interpretation without assumptions of fraud or intent

## **2. Datasets Used (1 page)**

### ✍️ Draft Text

> The analysis uses the Aadhaar datasets provided by UIDAI as part of the hackathon, covering biometric updates, demographic updates, and enrolment records.
>
> **Core datasets used:**
>
> **Biometric Dataset**
>
> * Date
> * State
> * District
> * Pincode
> * Biometric updates (age 5–17, age 17+)
>
> **Demographic Dataset**
>
> * Date
> * State
> * District
> * Pincode
> * Demographic updates (age 5–17, age 17+)
>
> **Enrolment Dataset**
>
> * Date
> * State
> * District
> * Pincode
> * Enrolments (age 0–5, 5–17, 18+)
>
> These datasets were analyzed across a daily time horizon at district level.
>
> **Supplementary datasets** (used only for contextual interpretation):
>
> * Census population and literacy (district level)
> * State-level economic indicators
> * Election calendar metadata
>
> No external dataset was used for anomaly detection itself.

## **3. Methodology (2–3 pages)**

### ✍️ Draft Text (Structured)

### 3.1 Data Cleaning & Validation

> Raw CSV shards were consolidated and validated. State, district, and pincode fields were standardized. Exact duplicate rows were identified and removed to prevent artificial inflation of counts. Date formats were strictly validated.

### 3.2 Geographic Integrity Audits

> Cross-validation checks were performed to identify pincodes mapped to multiple districts or states. Such cases were flagged as geographic ambiguities rather than corrected automatically.

### 3.3 Temporal Alignment & Aggregation

> All datasets were aligned temporally and aggregated to a **district-day** level to enable consistent comparison across biometric, enrolment, and demographic activities.

### 3.4 Anomaly Detection

> Rolling baselines were computed to detect abnormal deviations in biometric and enrolment volumes. Structural shocks were defined as cases where biometric activity surged while enrolment dropped significantly.

### 3.5 Change-Point Detection

> Change-point detection using the PELT algorithm was applied to identify statistically significant regime shifts in district-level activity patterns.

### 3.6 Persistence Analysis

> Anomalies were classified based on duration:
>
> * **NEW** (1–6 days)
> * **PERSISTENT** (7–20 days)
> * **CHRONIC** (≥21 days)
>
> This distinction is critical for administrative prioritization.

### 3.7 Composite Anomaly Scoring

> Multiple signals were combined into a single, explainable composite anomaly score, enabling ranking and comparison across districts while retaining interpretability.

---

## **4. Data Analysis & Visualisation (3 pages)**

### ✍️ Draft Text

> The analysis reveals that while most anomalies are short-lived, a smaller subset of districts exhibit persistent or chronic deviations. These cases warrant focused administrative attention.
>
> State-level heatmaps show temporal clustering of change-points, suggesting systemic events rather than isolated district failures. Persistence patterns indicate that operational imbalances often extend beyond a single reporting cycle.

## 📊 **THE ONE PERFECT SUMMARY FIGURE (MANDATORY)**

### **Figure Title**

> **From Daily Noise to Actionable Governance Signals**

### **Figure Design (Single Composite Figure)**

**A 3-panel horizontal figure:**

---

### **Panel A — Detection**

📈 Line plot of a district’s biometric vs enrolment activity

* Highlight detected **change-points**
* Show rolling baseline

Label:

> *“Statistical regime changes detected objectively”*

---

### **Panel B — Persistence**

📊 Bar or timeline showing anomaly duration

* NEW → PERSISTENT → CHRONIC

Label:

> *“Distinguishing transient noise from systemic issues”*

---

### **Panel C — Decision**

🗂️ Ranked table snippet (top 5 districts)

* Severity
* Days persistent
* Recommended action tier

Label:

> *“Clear prioritisation for administrative action”*

---

### Why this figure is perfect:

✔ Explains your **entire pipeline visually**
✔ Understandable in 30 seconds
✔ Appeals to both technical and non-technical jurors
✔ Tells a complete story without text

## **5. Key Insights & Impact (1–2 pages)**

### ✍️ Draft Text

> **Key Insights**
>
> * Most Aadhaar activity fluctuations are short-lived and self-correcting.
> * A smaller subset of districts shows persistent or chronic anomalies.
> * Structural shocks often align with broader administrative or electoral cycles.
> * Persistent anomalies are geographically concentrated, enabling targeted intervention.
>
> **Impact & Applicability**
>
> * Enables early warning dashboards for UIDAI and state registrars
> * Supports evidence-based allocation of audit and operational resources
> * Reduces reliance on anecdotal reporting
> * Enhances transparency and accountability without assuming wrongdoing

---

## **6. Conclusion & Future Scope (1 page)**

### ✍️ Draft Text

> This study demonstrates how explainable statistical methods can unlock meaningful societal and administrative insights from Aadhaar data. By focusing on persistence, governance relevance, and interpretability, the framework bridges the gap between data analysis and real-world decision-making.
>
> Future extensions may include interactive dashboards, state-specific policy overlays, and periodic monitoring systems integrated into operational workflows.
